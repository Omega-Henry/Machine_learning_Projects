# Machine Learning Projects

This repository collects my small, focused **machine learning** projects and notebooks.  
I’ll keep adding new ones over time.

## ✅ Currently Included
- **Naive_Bayes (Notebook):** basic Naive Bayes workflow (data prep → train → evaluate).
- **XGBoost (Notebook):** quick demo using XGBoost for tabular ML.

> File names in the repo right now: `Naive_Baiyes.ipynb`, `XGBoost.ipynb`.
